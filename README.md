# Implementation of IMPALA algorithm for starcraft 2

Application of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in real time strategy games.
– Tools & technologies used: PySC2, Stable Baselines 3, Starcraft 2
– Trained a Reinforcement Learning agent using Deep Q Network and Proximal Policy Optimization and after
training over 1 lakh episodes achieved a 78% win rate against inbuilt medium bot with a precison of 76.7%.
